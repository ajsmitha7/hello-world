# hello-world
my first repository!

Some things about me go here! I'm not always good at learning things abstractly, without understand what the goal is. If the goal or destination is too abstracted AND the there's some level of complexity, I can't focus. Is that true? I sort of like learning some things for their own sake, like math. Is it just cause the conceptual underpinnings are clear to me? Is it just that the foundations are taken care of? With this, there are immediately 100 terms and things I don't understand, and trying to piece the puzzle together without seeing the box isn't my idea of a fun time.
